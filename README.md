# stocks-analysis
## Overview of the project
* The main purpose and scope of this project can be summarised as:
  - To run a comparative analysis of years 2017 and 2018
  - To show the elapsed run time for the refactored code
  - To provide a visually indicative analysis of return by assigning green to the positive return and red to negative return

## Result of the data analysis
* Comparing the two years we run the stock analysis, most of the stocks brought good return in 2017, and most stocks lost great amount in the year of 2018
* Unlike other stocks, TERP lost in both years (although their lost was mild in both years)
* Both ENPH and RUN gained in both years 
* DQ was the most profitable in 2017, but it ended up with the highest percentage of loss in year 2018
* AY was not too volatile compared to other socks with mixed results. In 2018, AY gained 8.9% in 2017 and lost 7.3% in 2018. 
## Summary, conclusion and Recommendations
* Summary: The following summary can be presented from the project
 - The 2 conscutaive years end up completely different in their profitability
 - Only handful of the stocks were profitable both years
 - The stock that was targeted by steve and his parents is the most volitile with the highest retunr in 2017 and the highest percentage of loss in 2018
* Conclusion: After this thorough analysis it could be concluded
 - Overall, green energy stocks didn't show consistency in 2 consucative years...maybe it could have been different if we had more data from other years
 - Our anlysis determined not to trust the high return of stocks in one year if it is not cosistent
 * Recommendations:
  - Next time Steve decides to run an analysis, it is recomended to get data from more years to give us better picture
